This is a simple project with a working pipeline for building and distributing sphinx documentation through GitHub Pages â€” mostly because I can't find an immediate use for this, and will 100% have forgotten about it by the time I do.

The workflow has the following steps:

1. A push to the _main_ branch (containing markdown source) triggers a sphinx HTML build.
2. The HTML build is dropped to the _gh-pages_ branch.
3. The website, hosted by Pages, gets updated accordingly to the new HTML content in _gh-pages_

The two main steps to set this up were:
1. Set up ammaraskar's [sphinx-action](https://github.com/ammaraskar/sphinx-action) GitHub action in a yml file in **.github/workflows**. For a full example, see [sphinx-action-test](https://github.com/ammaraskar/sphinx-action-test).
2. On the **Settings/Pages** tab, set GitHub Pages to follow the _gh-pages_ branch.
